# Back End Commerce Database

## Description

As a manager at an internet retail company, I want a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies so that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

## Installation

To install the necessary packages, open your CLI and navigate to the root directory.

Once you are in the root directory, run the command `npm i`.

Next, set up the .env file. I have provided an example file to start from with the necessary variables already created. All you need to do is insert your MySQL username and password and remove the .EXAMPLE extension.

## Usage

To use this application, simply create a database named ecommerce_db in MySQL. 

Next, run the command `node server.js` in the CLI to start the server.

Finally, using Insomnia or some other API tester, use the API routes to create, read, update, and delete data in the database.

Here is a video showing how to use the application: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vgECakMXYhQLjIIhZ_NX0SsdZ3n3ZgcH/view
